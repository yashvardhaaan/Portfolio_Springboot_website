                            Started my engineering journey with a focus on programming fundamentals, development, and problem-solving. In my first year, I explored Python and built my first project — an Arduino-based fire extinguisher robot that detects fire and sprays water automatically.

                            In my second year, I developed strong foundations in object-oriented programming using C++ and Java. I also deepened my understanding of data structures and algorithms. As part of a team project, I developed <strong>EmotionPix</strong> — a real-time emotion-based movie recommendation system using Python, Flask, and camera integration.

                            Currently in my third year, I am focused on backend development with Java and Spring Boot. I am also exploring frontend integration and building full-stack applications. Alongside development, I am actively preparing for competitive coding and sharpening my problem-solving skills.
